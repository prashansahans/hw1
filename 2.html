        <p>An operating system is a program that manages a computer’s hardware. It
also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary
between the computer user and the computer hardware. An amazing aspect of
operating systems is how they vary in accomplishing these tasks. Mainframe
operating systems are designed primarily to optimize utilization of hardware.
Personal computer (PC) operating systems support complex games, business
applications, and everything in between. Operating systems for mobile computers
provide an environment in which a user can easily interface with the
computer to execute programs. Thus, some operating systems are designed to
be convenient, others to be efficient, and others to be some combination of the
two.
Before we can explore the details of computer system operation, we need to
know something about system structure. We thus discuss the basic functions
of system startup, I/O, and storage early in this chapter. We also describe
the basic computer architecture that makes it possible to write a functional
operating system.
Because an operating system is large and complex, it must be created
piece by piece. Each of these pieces should be a well-delineated portion of the
system, with carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions. In this chapter,
we provide a general overview of the major components of a contemporary
computer system as well as the functions provided by the operating system.
Additionally, we cover several other topics to help set the stage for the
remainder of this text: data structures used in operating systems, computing
environments, and open-source operating systems.

1.1 What Operating Systems Do
We begin our discussion by looking at the operating system’s role in the
overall computer system. A computer system can be divided roughly into four
components: the hardware, the operating system, the application programs,
and the users (Figure 1.1).
The hardware—the central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the
input/output (I/O) devices—provides the basic computing resources for the
system. The application programs—such as word processors, spreadsheets,
compilers, and Web browsers—define the ways in which these resources are
used to solve users’ computing problems. The operating system controls the
hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for
the various users.
We can also view a computer system as consisting of hardware, software,
and data. The operating system provides the means for proper use of these
resources in the operation of the computer system. An operating system is
similar to a government. Like a government, it performs no useful function by
itself. It simply provides an environment within which other programs can do
useful work.
To understand more fully the operating system’s role, we next explore
operating systems from two viewpoints: that of the user and that of the system.
1.1.1 User View
            An operating system is a program that manages a computer’s hardware. It
also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary
between the computer user and the computer hardware. An amazing aspect of
operating systems is how they vary in accomplishing these tasks. Mainframe
operating systems are designed primarily to optimize utilization of hardware.
Personal computer (PC) operating systems support complex games, business
applications, and everything in between. Operating systems for mobile computers

The user’s view of the computer varies according to the interface being
used. Most computer users sit in front of a PC, consisting of a monitor,
keyboard, mouse, and system unit. Such a system is designed for one user

to monopolize its resources. The goal is to maximize the work (or play) that
the user is performing. In this case, the operating system is designed mostly
for ease of use, with some attention paid to performance and none paid
to resource utilization—how various hardware and software resources are
shared. Performance is, of course, important to the user; but such systems
are optimized for the single-user experience rather than the requirements of
multiple users.
In other cases, a user sits at a terminal connected to a mainframe or a
minicomputer. Other users are accessing the same computer through other
terminals. These users share resources and may exchange information. The
operating system in such cases is designed to maximize resource utilization—
to assure that all available CPU time, memory, and I/O are used efficiently and
that no individual user takes more than her fair share.
In still other cases, users sit at workstations connected to networks of
other workstations and servers. These users have dedicated resources at
their disposal, but they also share resources such as networking and servers,
including file, compute, and print servers. Therefore, their operating system is
designed to compromise between individual usability and resource utilization.
Recently, many varieties of mobile computers, such as smartphones and
tablets, have come into fashion. Most mobile computers are standalone units for
individual users. Quite often, they are connected to networks through cellular
or other wireless technologies. Increasingly, thesemobile devices are replacing
desktop and laptop computers for people who are primarily interested in
using computers for e-mail and web browsing. The user interface for mobile
computers generally features a touch screen, where the user interactswith the
system by pressing and swiping fingers across the screen rather than using a
physical keyboard and mouse.
Some computers have little or no user view. For example, embedded
computers in home devices and automobiles may have numeric keypads and
may turn indicator lights on or off to show status, but they and their operating
systems are designed primarily to run without user intervention.
1.1.2 System View
From the computer’s point of view, the operating system is the program
most intimately involved with the hardware. In this context, we can view
an operating system as a resource allocator. A computer system has many
resources that may be required to solve a problem: CPU time, memory space,
file-storage space, I/O devices, and so on. The operating system acts as the
manager of these resources. Facing numerous and possibly conflicting requests
for resources, the operating system must decidehow to allocate them to specific
programs and users so that it can operate the computer system efficiently and
fairly.Aswe have seen, resource allocation is especially important where many
users access the same mainframe or minicomputer.
A slightly different view of an operating system emphasizes the need to
control the various I/O devices and user programs. An operating system is a
control program. A control program manages the execution of user programs
to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It is especially concerned
with the operation and control of I/O devices.

1.1.3 Defining Operating Systems
By now, you can probably see that the term operating system covers many roles
and functions. That is the case, at least in part, because of the myriad designs
and uses of computers. Computers are present within toasters, cars, ships,
spacecraft, homes, and businesses. They are the basis for game machines, music
players, cable TV tuners, and industrial control systems. Although computers
have a relatively short history, they have evolved rapidly. Computing started
as an experiment to determine what could be done and quickly moved to
fixed-purpose systems for military uses, such as code breaking and trajectory
plotting, and governmental uses, such as census calculation. Those early
computers evolved into general-purpose, multifunction mainframes, and
that’s when operating systems were born. In the 1960s, Moore’s Law predicted
that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every
eighteen months, and that prediction has held true. Computers gained in
functionality and shrunk in size, leading to a vast number of uses and a vast
number and variety of operating systems. (See Chapter 20 for more details on
the history of operating systems.)
How, then, can we define what an operating system is? In general, we have
no completely adequate definition of an operating system. Operating systems
exist because they offer a reasonable way to solve the problem of creating a
usable computing system. The fundamental goal of computer systems is to
execute user programs and to make solving user problems easier. Computer
hardware is constructed toward this goal. Since bare hardware alone is not
particularly easy to use, application programs are developed. These programs
require certain common operations, such as those controlling the I/O devices.
The common functions of controlling and allocating resources are then brought
together into one piece of software: the operating system.
In addition,wehave no universally accepted definition of what is part of the
operating system. A simple viewpoint is that it includes everything a vendor
ships when you order “the operating system.” The features included, however,
vary greatly across systems. Some systems take up less than a megabyte of
space and lack even a full-screen editor, whereas others require gigabytes of
space and are based entirely on graphical windowing systems.Amore common
definition, and the one that we usually follow, is that the operating system
is the one program running at all times on the computer—usually called
the kernel. (Along with the kernel, there are two other types of programs:
system programs, which are associatedwith the operating systembut are not
necessarily part of the kernel, and application programs, which include all
programs not associated with the operation of the system.)
The matter of what constitutes an operating system became increasingly
important as personal computers became more widespread and operating
systems grew increasingly sophisticated. In 1998, the United States Department
of Justice filed suit against Microsoft, in essence claiming that Microsoft
included too much functionality in its operating systems and thus prevented
application vendors from competing. (For example, a Web browser was an
integral part of the operating systems.) As a result, Microsoft was found guilty
of using its operating-system monopoly to limit competition.
Today, however, if we look at operating systems for mobile devices, we
see that once again the number of features constituting the operating system
1.2 Computer-System Organization 7
is increasing. Mobile operating systems often include not only a core kernel
but also middleware—a set of software frameworks that provide additional
services to application developers. For example, each of the two most prominent
mobile operating systems—Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android—features
a core kernel alongwithmiddleware that supportsdatabases,multimedia, and
graphics (to name a only few).
1.2 Computer-System Organization
Before we can explore the details of how computer systems operate, we need
general knowledge of the structure of a computer system. In this section,
we look at several parts of this structure. The section is mostly concerned
with computer-system organization, so you can skim or skip it if you already
understand the concepts.
1.2.1 Computer-System Operation
A modern general-purpose computer system consists of one or more CPUs
and a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that
provides access to shared memory (Figure 1.2). Each device controller is in
charge of a specific type of device (for example, disk drives, audio devices,
or video displays). The CPU and the device controllers can execute in parallel,
competing for memory cycles. To ensure orderly access to the shared memory,
a memory controller synchronizes access to thememory.
For a computer to start running—for instance, when it is powered up or
rebooted—it needs to have an initial program to run. This initial program,
or bootstrap program, tends to be simple. Typically, it is stored within
the computer hardware in read-only memory (ROM) or electrically erasable
programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), known by the general term
firmware. It initializes all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to device
controllers tomemorycontents. The bootstrap program mustknowhowto load
the operating system and how to start executing that system. To accomplish

this goal, the bootstrap program must locate the operating-system kernel and
load it into memory.
Once the kernel is loaded and executing, it can start providing services to
the system and its users. Some services are provided outside of the kernel, by
system programs that are loaded into memory at boot time to become system
processes, or system daemons that run the entire time the kernel is running.
On UNIX, the first systemprocess is “init,” and it starts many other daemons.
Once this phase is complete, the system is fully booted, and the system waits
for some event to occur.
The occurrence of an event is usually signaled by an interrupt from either
the hardware or the software. Hardware may trigger an interrupt at any time
by sending a signal to the CPU, usually by way of the system bus. Software
may trigger an interrupt by executing a special operation called a system call
(also called a monitor call).
When the CPU is interrupted, it stops what it is doing and immediately
transfers execution to a fixed location. The fixed location usually contains
the starting address where the service routine for the interrupt is located.
The interrupt service routine executes; on completion, the CPU resumes the
interrupted computation. A timeline of this operation is shown in Figure 1.3.
Interrupts are an important part of a computer architecture. Each computer
design has its own interrupt mechanism, but several functions are common.
The interrupt must transfer control to the appropriate interrupt service routine.
The straightforward method for handling this transfer</p>
    
    <H2 ID="c2"><B>chapter 2</B></H2>
    <p>In Chapter 6, we showed how the CPU can be shared by a set of processes. As
a result of CPU scheduling, we can improve both the utilization of the CPU and
the speed of the computer’s response to its users. To realize this increase in
performance, however, we must keep several processes in memory—that is,
we must share memory.
In this chapter, we discuss various ways to manage memory. The memorymanagement
algorithms vary from a primitive bare-machine approach to
paging and segmentation strategies. Each approach has its own advantages
and disadvantages. Selection of a memory-management method for a specific
system depends on many factors, especially on the hardware design of the
system. As we shall see, many algorithms require hardware support, leading
many systems to have closely integrated hardware and operating-system
memory management.
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
• To provide a detailed description of various ways of organizing memory
hardware.
• To explore various techniques of allocating memory to processes.
• To discuss in detail how paging works in contemporary computer systems.
8.1 Background
As we saw in Chapter 1, memory is central to the operation of a modern
computer system. Memory consists of a large array of bytes, each with its own
address. The CPU fetches instructions from memory according to the value of
the program counter. These instructions may cause additional loading from
and storing to specific memory addresses.
A typical instruction-execution cycle, for example, first fetches an instruction
from memory. The instruction is then decoded and may cause operands
to be fetched from memory. After the instruction has been executed on the
operands, results may be stored back in memory. The memory unit sees only
351

a streamof memory addresses; it does not know how they are generated (by
the instruction counter, indexing, indirection, literal addresses, and so on) or
what they are for (instructions or data). Accordingly, we can ignore how a
program generates a memory address. We are interested only in the sequence
of memory addresses generated by the running program.
We begin our discussion by covering several issues that are pertinent
to managing memory: basic hardware, the binding of symbolic memory
addresses to actual physical addresses, and the distinction between logical
and physical addresses.We conclude the section with a discussion of dynamic
linking and shared libraries.
8.1.1 Basic Hardware
Main memory and the registers built into the processor itself are the only
general-purpose storage that the CPU can access directly. There are machine
instructions that take memory addresses as arguments, but none that take disk
addresses. Therefore, any instructions in execution, and any data being used
by the instructions, must be in one of these direct-access storage devices. If the
data are not in memory, they must be moved there before the CPU can operate
on them.
Registers that are built into the CPU are generally accessible within one
cycle of the CPU clock. Most CPUs can decode instructions and performsimple
operations on register contents at the rate of one or more operations per
clock tick. The same cannot be said of main memory, which is accessed via
a transaction on the memory bus. Completing a memory access may take
many cycles of the CPU clock. In such cases, the processor normally needs to
stall, since it does not have the data requiredto complete the instruction that it
is executing. This situation is intolerable because of the frequency of memory
accesses. The remedy is to add fastmemorybetween the CPUand mainmemory,
typically on the CPU chip for fast access. Such a cache was described in Section
1.8.3. To manage a cache built into the CPU, the hardware automatically speeds
up memory access without any operating-system control.
Not only are we concerned with the relative speed of accessing physical
memory, but we also must ensure correct operation. For proper system
operation we must protect the operating system from access by user processes.
On multiuser systems, we must additionally protect user processes from
one another. This protection must be provided by the hardware because the
operating system doesn’t usually intervene between the CPU and its memory
accesses (because of the resulting performance penalty). Hardware implements
this production in several different ways, as we show throughout the chapter.
Here, we outline one possible implementation.
We first need to make sure that each process has a separate memory space.
Separate per-process memory space protects the processes from each other and
is fundamental to having multiple processes loaded in memory for concurrent
execution. To separate memory spaces, we need the ability to determine the
range of legal addresses that the process may access and to ensure that the
process can access only these legal addresses. We can provide this protection
by using two registers, usually a base and a limit, as illustrated in Figure 8.1.
The base register holds the smallest legal physical memory address; the limit
register specifies the size of the range. For example, if the base register holds

300040 and the limit register is 120900, then the program can legally access all
addresses from 300040 through 420939 (inclusive).
Protection of memory space is accomplished by having the CPU hardware
compare every address generated in user mode with the registers. Any attempt
by a program executing in user mode to access operating-system memory or
other users’ memory results in a trap to the operating system, which treats the
attempt as a fatal error (Figure 8.2). This scheme prevents a user program from
(accidentally or deliberately) modifying the code or data structures of either
the operating system or other users.
The base and limit registers can be loaded only by the operating system,
which uses a special privileged instruction. Since privileged instructions can
be executed only in kernel mode, and since only the operati</p>
